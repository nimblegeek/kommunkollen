  "description": "this project will be a simple dashboard, enabling the user to put in their monthly salary,   state their home-municipality and quickly get an overview of how much tax is paid and where it   goes, also enabling the user to drill down on the dashboard and exploer more about the cost   structures and different budgets in the \"kommun\". in sweden it is public information but most   supplier invoices are pretty hidden and needs to be manually inserted into a database. I want   to prepare for either calling an external api with that info or build an own database.",
